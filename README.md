# Vehicle-Classification

Vehicle classification has emerged as a critical component in the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and advanced traffic management solutions. With the exponential growth of urban traffic and the pressing need for enhanced road safety, efficient vehicle classification plays a pivotal role in optimizing traffic flow, reducing congestion, and improving overall road infrastructure planning. This thesis delves into the application of state-of-the-art image classification algorithms for vehicle classification, leveraging the capabilities of deep learning and computer vision. Our research investigates the performance of several cutting-edge algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transfer Learning models such as ResNet, MobileNetV2, VGG-19, and hybrid approaches that combine traditional machine learning with modern deep learning techniques. We utilize a diverse dataset comprising images of vehicles from various categories, including cars, auto-rickshaws, motorcycles, and bicycles, captured under different environmental conditions such as day and night, rain, and varying traffic densities. The proposed methodology involves rigorous preprocessing, feature extraction, and model optimization to ensure high classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Comparative analysis of the algorithms is conducted based on metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and processing time. Furthermore, we explore the integration of these algorithms into real-time systems, addressing challenges such as scalability, latency, and adaptability to dynamic environments. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of advanced image classification algorithms to significantly enhance vehicle classification accuracy, with implications for traffic monitoring, automated toll collection, and smart city applications. By presenting a comprehensive evaluation of different approaches, this thesis aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in intelligent transportation systems and pave the way for future advancements in automated vehicle analysis.
